### Procedure

### Apparatus:
 

Conductivity Meter, Physical Balance, Beaker, Glass Rod, etc.


<h3>Determination of Soil Conductivity:</h3>

<h4>a) Calibration of Instrument Using 0.01 N KCl Solution:</h4>
<p>
  Dissolve 74.5 g KCl in 100 ml conductivity water free from CO<sub>2</sub>. This is the standard reference solution whose conductance is 1412 µS/cm at 25&deg;C.
</p>
<p>
  Take this KCl solution in a 100 ml beaker; dip the electrode in it. If the conductivity meter does not read 1412 µS/cm, then adjust the instrument to read 1412.
</p>

<h4>b) Conductivity Measurement:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Weigh 5 g of soil into a beaker and add 25 mL distilled water.</li>
  <li>Stir well for about 5–10 minutes and allow it to settle for some time.</li>
  <li>Transfer the distillate into another beaker for conductivity measurement.</li>
  <li>Thoroughly rinse the cell one or more times with the sample.</li>
  <li>Read the sample conductivity directly from the conductivity meter.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Points to Remember while Performing the Experiment in a Real Laboratory:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Always wear a lab coat and gloves when in the lab.</li>
  <li>Switch on the exhaust fan and check availability of all required chemicals and reagents.</li>
  <li>Prepare reagents if not available using appropriate components.</li>
  <li>Adjust the Bunsen burner to a proper flame – a small blue cone.</li>
  <li>Clean all apparatus with chromic acid and distilled water. Ensure they are free from water droplets.</li>
  <li>Calibrate the electronic weighing balance before taking measurements.</li>
  <li>Ensure the desiccator contains sufficient desiccant like silica gel.</li>
  <li>Clean the crucible with chromic acid, heat it, cool it, and handle only with clean tongs or tissue paper (never by hand).</li>
  <li>Switch on the oven and set the temperature to 130°C. Use cotton gloves when working with the oven.</li>
  <li>Clean the Kipp's apparatus tube with water. Ensure it contains enough iron sulfide and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to produce H<sub>2</sub>S gas.</li>
  <li>Clean all glassware with soap and distilled water. Recap reagent bottles after use.</li>
  <li>Switch off lights, exhaust fan, oven, and gas cylinder before leaving the lab.</li>
  <li>Discard used gloves in the designated waste bin.</li>
</ul>
