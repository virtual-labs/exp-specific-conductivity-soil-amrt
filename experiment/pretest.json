        "a": "Salinity",
        "b": "Silt",
        "c": "Sand",
        "d": "Clay"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Salinity generally increases conductivity due to dissolved ions.",
        "b": "Silt has moderate conductivity due to fine particles.",
        "c": "Sand has the lowest conductivity due to large particles and poor ion retention.",
        "d": "Clay usually has high conductivity due to high cation exchange capacity."
